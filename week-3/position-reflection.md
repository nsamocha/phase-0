What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

I'm not to clear on the exact differences, but I noticed that there were some clear differences in what it did to my boxes. If I put relative, then some of the boxes would scroll down with you. If I put static, then they wouldn't move at all. The easiest one to use was absolute because it made my code work the way I expected it too.

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Margin is the outside space, border is inside the marging and padding the space between the content.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I liked it. It let me learn something important that I needed to know to make my website.
