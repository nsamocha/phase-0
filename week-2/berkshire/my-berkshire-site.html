<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was cool to see how the skills I learned in codeacademy can be used to build an actualy website. It was pretty easy compared to other things I've done so far in this course.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
At times it was hard to find what I was looking for, like the geico image, and how to make it as small as I wanted.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Well I'm still having troube using the relative path methods to making links. Other then that I think I'm practicing correctly.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Its good because it's generally easy to use, but the bad side to it is, you cant customize as much as you'd like to.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Not really a trick, but on codeacademy glossary they basiclly give you all the html text you need to know.
