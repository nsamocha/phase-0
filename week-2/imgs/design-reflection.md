What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery and, maintenance.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's purpose is tell people about myself and my interest. The content will have my blog for phase-0 and everything I'm learning so far. It will eventually be a place to showcase everything I can do as a programmer.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My audience's interest are my classmates who might be interested in learning anything I know, and eventually maybe people looking to hire a programmer would be interested in what I can make for them.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action depends on the user. If the user wants to learn something about programming he/she would go on my blog. If they were interested about me personally, they would go to my about me section.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
The most important thing in design is making sure the user can navigate through your website easily. Having a website that looks nice is important too, but having it work like it should is even more vital.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is the part of the website that the user actually interacts with. It is all the links they click on and the function of website itself. It's valubale because even if the design of your website isn't something so great, your website can still be proffesional as long as its user experience design is done right.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
For once nothing has been that tedious.
