What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is basiclly how your website looks like, and how the user will interact with that website.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
It gives you a chance to see the blue-prints of your website.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes, it lets me feel creative.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with my first idea, although its very basic and theres almost nothing on it.
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I had the usual problem of saving my commits, but I looked online and watched some videos on youtube. Also at first I didn't really understand what a wireframe was.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
Making the wireframe was very enjoyable, but using the markdown method didn't work for me no matter what I tried.
