How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
I know You can use irb, but I don't know how to use it through sublime.

How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
You wright rspec followed by the file name.

What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
A few things. Some of them were basic like making a copy from github into a new directory. The other problems I had was doing the rspec check. I might have just got the syntax wrong but I tried a few things and they didn't work. I thought my code was just bad but I tested it out on codeacademy labs. The only other thing I had issues with is working directly on sublime. I have been using labs to write my code and to see if it works, then I copy the code I make into sublime to save it.
