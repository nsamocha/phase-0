What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a real number, a float is an object that represents an inexact real number.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Basiclly using integer division would get you a whole number, but a float would get you the exact number. For example, if you were to divide 9 and 5 as integers, then you would only get 1. If you were using float numbers you would get 1.8.
```
Hours in a year
year = 365
day = 24
hoursInYear = year * day

Minutes in a decade
decade = 20
hour = 60
hoursInYear = 8760
minutesInDecade = hoursInYear * hour * decade
```
