What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a real number, a float is an object that represents an inexact real number.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Basiclly using integer division would get you a whole number, but a float would get you the exact number. For example, if you were to divide 9 and 5 as integers, then you would only get 1. If you were using float numbers you would get 1.8.
```
Hours in a year
year = 365
day = 24
hoursInYear = year * day

Minutes in a decade
decade = 20
hour = 60
hoursInYear = 8760
minutesInDecade = hoursInYear * hour * decade
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Everything but division is very straight forward. Except in division where if you want an exact number you need to use a float number for one of the numbers in the problem.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

An integer is a real number, a float is an object that represents an inexact real number.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer will give you an whole number, while float will give you an exact number.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are messages that are printed out on the console. You can save them to a variable or print them directly.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

A local variable is a variable that has a lowercase letter to start it, and they don't have nil at the end of it. I definitly got a good review for some of the basics of ruby. It's been a long time since I've used, since I finished up my private studying before devbootcamp on javascript. Although they are not that different it was good to get a refresher on the syntax.
