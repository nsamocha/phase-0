1.1 Think About Time reflections
I did my research on both the time boxing and mindfulness for productivity. I found that both these techniques had something that I should learn from, considering the way I get myself to be productive.  As for my time management, I never really consciously manage my time. Especially when it comes to things I have to do. I either procrastinate to the last minute or do very little whenever I'm in the mood. This has generally worked for me over the years, especially when I procrastinate, because the added pressure makes me do better work. Still, the amount of times it hasn't worked for me, makes it worth trying to change my habits. When I was reading about time boxing, at first it sounded a little constricting to me. Then after thinking about for a little I realized that if I did set specific times out of the day where I would be productive and finished at the time I set for myself, then I would have to do the same thing with what I enjoy doing. This would let me enjoy my free time and not feel guilty about it since I know that I"m on schedule. On top of time boxing, if I used the mindfulness technique then I would actually use those time slots I have more efficiently, and not resist them so much. When I use to study programming by myself, I would practice a kind of meditation i learned from my eastern religion teacher known as a zazen. Its a buddhist technique, where you leave your eyes open but slanted downward. This technique worked for me very well and it remind me a lot of mindfulness meditation. It lets my mind let go of all other thoughts and makes me grounded in the moment.
1.2 The Command Line reflection
From what I understood from the material I read and watched shell and bash are what you use to get beyond what your computer can do through its operating system, which is meant to make it easier for you to use the computer.

The most challenging aspect of learning this would have to be all the text that comes up when you type in a command. At first it all looked like random computer stuff that I didn't understand (which it still kind of does), but when I stopped and read through what popped up in the terminal I noticed it wasn't so complex.

Once I started understanding how to move through one command to the other, it wasn't so intimidating to me. Which was great considering the fact that I don't have that much experience using computers aside from going on the internet.

The most important command that I used would have to be the help command. At least for me it was. This was because it gives you instructions at the top on how to find out more information which I used while setting up my computer during the installation process in week 0.

pwd = print working directory, ls = list directory mv = move, cd = change directory, mkdir = make directory, less = page through a file rmdir = remove directory rm = remove, help = gives a list of commands and a way to get more info
1.4 Forking and Clone reflections
If I were to give someone instructions the only real advice I would have to give them is to use the written instructions that I used. I wouldn't have much else to tell them because I'm still unsure myself if I did it correctly.

If you fork a repository, you can work on your project without affecting the master file.

The struggles I had while setting up git and Github was manly using my command line. I couldn't understand what I was doing half the time, and I couldn't find the files I was supposed to already have.
